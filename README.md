# Real-Time_Multi-threaded_Application_Simulator
Developed a simulator to demonstrate multithreading models (e.g., Many-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many) and thread synchronization using semaphores and monitors. The simulator should visualize thread states and interactions, providing insights into thread management and CPU scheduling in multi-threaded environments
